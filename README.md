Dark Default Skin
====
![Max. LMS Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/MAX._LMS_Version_Supported-8.5.x-red)<br>

Just like the LMS *Default skin*, but some UI elements have darker colors.<br>

For LMS versions >= 9 please take a look at the [**Dark Logic** Skin](https://github.com/AF-1/lms-darklogicskin).<br><br>

## What it is and what it is not
The only purpose of *Dark Default Skin* is to provide a dark-themed version of the *LMS Default skin* where some UI elements have darker colors.<br>
It's only about the **colors** of the UI elements, **not** about adding or (re)moving UI elements, and definitely not about changing how *LMS Default skin* works. *Dark Default Skin* does and will **not** provide any additional functionality beyond that of the *LMS Default skin*. And some UI elements are not modified.
