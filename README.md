Dark Default Skin
====

Just like Logitech Media Server's *Default skin*, but some UI elements (esp. backgrounds) have a different (darker) color.<br><br>
⚠️ Please **clear your browser cache** after switching or updating web skins and **reload** the browser page (multiple times if necessary).<br>

If the **log viewer** does not use the dark style(s), please update LMS to the lastest version of 8.3.1+ or 8.4+.

## What it is and what it is not
The only purpose of *Dark Default Skin* is to provide a slightly different/darker version of the *LMS Default skin*. It does and will **not** provide any additional functionality beyond that of the *LMS Default skin*.<br><br>And some UI elements are not modified. Example: I thought about replacing the green gradient of the background with a grey one but I didn't because the divider and the dark scrollbars / sliders (esp. the lower part) are harder to distinguish then.
