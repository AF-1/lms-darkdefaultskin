## Requirements

- LMS version **<** 9

<br><br>

## What it is and what it is not
The only purpose of *Dark Default Skin* is to provide a dark-themed version of the *LMS Default skin* where some UI elements have darker colors.<br>
It's only about the **colors** of the UI elements, **not** about adding or (re)moving UI elements, and definitely not about changing how *LMS Default skin* works. *Dark Default Skin* does and will **not** provide any additional functionality beyond that of the *LMS Default skin*. And some UI elements are not modified.

* **Dark Default Skin** is available from the LMS plugin library: **LMS > Settings > Manage Plugins**.<br>

* Once the plugin is installed, go to *LMS* > *Settings* > *Interface*, select **Dark Default** and click *Apply*.

* Don't forget to **clear your browser cache**.
